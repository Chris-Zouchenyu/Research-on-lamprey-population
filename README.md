Adaptive sex ratio variation is a special phenomenon in the ecosystem, where the sex ratio of animals with this type of trait changes according to the external environment. This paper focuses on the ability of a typical example, the sea lamprey, to adapt to its environment by adjusting its sex ratio in the face of changes in resource availability and the effects of this trait on the ecosystem.
